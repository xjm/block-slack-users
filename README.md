</p>

## Install:
Clone the repo, go to chrome://extensions, enable developer mode, then load this as an unpacked extension.

## Features:
1. Hide messages from any User
2. Hide messages from any bot
3. Optionally allow messages to be hidden only from DMs

## How To Use:
1. Click on the extension icon or navigate to extension options.
2. Enter the `ID` of the user/bot you want to block. **NOTE:** This ID is not the slack handle the user/bot has, but the unique ID that slack assigns to every User/Bot.
3. You can get the ID of a member like so:
    1. Click in the member's photo in the Slack UI.
    2. Click again on the enlarged photo to open it in the sidebar.
    3. Click on the down arrow ("More actions") button there and select "Copy member ID".
4. You can block multiple users or bots by specifying their User IDs separated by `,`.
5. Make sure you want to make Slack a happy place again.
6. Save!
